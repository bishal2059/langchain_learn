# Learn Langchain

## Project Description

In this project I learned about the langchain.

## Setup

### 1. First setup env variable: Use the env.example to setup up necessary api keys from the listed services

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment, run the following command:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### 3. To use Firestore database: Download the firebase private keys json file and provide its path in the env file at GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS

### 4. To run a sample example

Run the specific python example using virtual env

```sh
python chat_models/chat_model_basic.py

```

#### In this way you can run other examples too.
